# Fishybot ESO ðŸŽ£
Auto fishing bot for Elder Scrolls Online. The Bot automatically fishes until the fishing hole disappears.  It also sends notification via discord when it stops fishing. We also have a leaderboard for the amount of fishes you caught. Become the master fisher and swim in perfect roes ðŸ˜‰
